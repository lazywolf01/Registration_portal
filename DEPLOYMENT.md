# Registration Portal - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Live Application
The Registration Portal is successfully deployed and accessible at:
**https://lazywolf01.github.io/Registration_portal/**

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. React Router Compatibility Issue
- **Problem**: The project was using `react-router-dom@7.7.0` which requires React 19, but the project uses React 18.3.1
- **Solution**: Downgraded `react-router-dom` to version `6.28.0` which is compatible with React 18
- **Error Fixed**: `'use' is not exported from 'react' (imported as 'React5')`

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration
- **Added**: Homepage field in `package.json` pointing to the GitHub Pages URL
- **Added**: Deployment scripts using `gh-pages` package
- **Result**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## 🛠️ Build Status
- ✅ **Build**: Successful
- ✅ **Deployment**: Successful
- ⚠️ **Warnings**: Minor ESLint warnings for unused variables (non-blocking)

## 📋 Current Warnings (Non-Critical)

- `AdminNotifications.tsx`
